Project works as we discussed previously with the index.php being the home file, found in the adress: 
'localhost/FamilyManager/View/account.php'

The register page is glitchy, but after 1 or 2 attempts will take the data (if viable) and send u to a 
confirmation page. If you confirm the new account, you are taken to a generic account page.
A new account is not yet created (couldnt figure that much out).

When trying to login, simply push the login button, since there are no accounts logging in takes you 
to a generic account page.

In the account page, all members are displayed firsthand and below the families. My loop was glitching when
I tried to display people within the family (improper nesting on my part I think). 

Clicking the edit button will change the information for people into textboxes but the save button does not 
work to apply any changes yet made.

When clicking the add button, you are redirected to the editPerson.php page where you can create a new person. 
Upon clicking save, a new person is saved and added to the database permanently.

Delete is also still not working.
